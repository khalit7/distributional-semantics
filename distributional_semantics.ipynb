And what's this big announcement he wants to make? _END_PREVLINE_ Hidden depths, hasn't he? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What? _END_PREVLINE_ Here's me thinking that husband of yours was a retro throwback to the dark ages when all the time - _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ All the time what? _END_PREVLINE_ We had a good long talk last night. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ After you went to bed. _END_PREVLINE_ We're getting together, Jane. _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT NIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Sometimes, in business, right, you have to get into bed with some unusual people - - well metaphorically speaking - - doesn't mean you have to stay there alright?

Phil around? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He popped out. _END_PREVLINE_ Where? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Still sore? _END_PREVLINE_ Bit. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Not like you to get caught Jack. _END_PREVLINE_ Bloke got lucky, that's all. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Thought Jase was supposed to throw out the drunks. That's what you pay him for, innit? _END_PREVLINE_ Yeah. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Yeah. _END_PREVLINE_ Won't happen again. _EOL_ Mornin'. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Ouch. Turning a very fetching shade of blue I see? _END_PREVLINE_ Reckon it suits me? It's my favourite colour. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What made Phil lose it like that? _END_PREVLINE_ Been asking myself the same thing. If this is what I get for trying to help, I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'm sorry. _END_PREVLINE_ Don't be. I'm a big boy now. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Don't be. I'm a big boy now. _END_PREVLINE_ Ron. The naked look suits you. GO _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ R AND R OFFICE INT NIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_ What are you doing hiding in here? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'm not. _END_PREVLINE_ Didn't think I'd see you tonight. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Why? _END_PREVLINE_ Mitchell factor. Circling the wagons. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ No-one tells me what to do. _END_PREVLINE_ Which is one of the things I like about you. We still solvent? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He's in pieces. So's Aunt Peg. If you'd seen her... _END_PREVLINE_ What can I do? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Phil thinks you set him up. That you knew Louise had a step-dad. _END_PREVLINE_ He's so predictable. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Did you Jack? _END_PREVLINE_ I did my bit. If Phil can't handle it, it's his problem. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ That's not an answer. It's all about scoring points with you two. Tit for tat. You win, he loses and vice versa. Boys playing their war games. _END_PREVLINE_ No. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ But there's a six year old girl stuck in the middle of this, and that ain't right. _END_PREVLINE_ Ronnie wait. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You're on your own from now on. I'm taking a break. _END_PREVLINE_ From this place? Or from me? _EOL_ Why would you walk away from your business? You're the one making it personal... _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ CAFE INT DAY LIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You've only been here five minutes. Anyway it's not down to you. _END_PREVLINE_ Can't stand to breathe the same air as me now? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Don't kid yourself. _END_PREVLINE_ Why run away in that case? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'm not. Vic's short-handed. Promised I'd help. _END_PREVLINE_ Sorry if I make you feel uncomfortable. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You don't. _END_PREVLINE_ I meant about Phil. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I know that. _END_PREVLINE_ Maybe I made a mistake by getting involved, but I knew how huge it was for him. Missing out on all those years ... watching his kids change, grow. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Maybe I made a mistake by getting involved, but I knew how huge it was for him. Missing out on all those years ... watching his kids change, grow. _END_PREVLINE_ I wouldn't wish that on anyone. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack... _END_PREVLINE_ But you're right. Phil hates my guts, and you don't deserve to be in the middle of it. _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ R AND R INT NIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_ Ronnie. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Before you get too excited, I'm here for the hens, not you. If you've forgotten the hen party Jack... _END_PREVLINE_ No, course not. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ So everything's under control? _END_PREVLINE_ Yeah. Now that you're here. Thanks Ron. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack? _END_PREVLINE_ Shouldn't the stripper be here by now? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Didn't you ring to confirm? _END_PREVLINE_ Didn't you? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack. _END_PREVLINE_ I've had other things on my mind. _EOL_ ...I know it's short notice but we're desperate. You can? Oh mate...I really owe you one. Get him over here asap will you? French Maid? Ain't a tranny actis he? I told you, I don't want a woman, I want a bloke! Yeah very funny. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Well? _END_PREVLINE_ Tried everyone. Nothing. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Where are you going? _END_PREVLINE_ Let you down. Sorry Ron. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You're not leaving me to deal with it... Jack! _END_PREVLINE_ I'm sorting it! _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ [NAME]'S FLAT INT STUDIO _END_SCENEINFO_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Crap! _END_PREVLINE_ Don't ask. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Where have you been? They're gonna walk in a minute. _END_PREVLINE_ Ladies. Would you like to take your places for the show? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack... you're not... ? _END_PREVLINE_ Told you I'd sort it, didn't I? _EOL_ I'm not a stripper. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'm not a stripper. _END_PREVLINE_ Sorry sweetheart, I'm taken. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Sorry sweetheart, I'm taken. _END_PREVLINE_ Yeah, bye. _EOL_ Girls have gone away happy. Am I a genius or what? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Ain't it illegal? Using your old uniform like that? _END_PREVLINE_ You gonna dob me in? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Maybe I should. So, how did you manage to talk Neil into it? _END_PREVLINE_ Let's just say he's expecting a bit extra in his pay packet this month. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Let's just say he's expecting a bit extra in his pay packet this month. _END_PREVLINE_ Lucky it wasn't ripped to shreds. Women eh? whoever called 'em the weaker sex was having a laugh. The look on your face... you thought it was going to be me, didn't you? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Wouldn't put it past you. _END_PREVLINE_ You disappointed? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ As if. _END_PREVLINE_ Could give you a private show if you like. Come on, I'll let you wear my hat. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Idiot. _END_PREVLINE_ Stay. ENDS _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ [NAME]'S FLAT, BEDROOM INT NIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_ You're not getting up to make me breakfast, are you. It was a mistake, right? We shouldn't have done it and let's forget it ever happened. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Something like that. _END_PREVLINE_ What if I don't want to? What if I want this to happen again? _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ [NAME]'S FLAT, KITCHEN INT DAY LIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_ Hey, get back to bed. This is meant to be a surprise. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ It's that, alright. _END_PREVLINE_ Yes, well, make the most of it. It's your turn next time. If there is a next time, obviously. Which I am in no way presuming. Cos we're business partners, and still very respectful of each other's boundaries - _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Whoah, slow down - we've got an audience, remember. Max won't say anything, will he? _END_PREVLINE_ You're going to have to tell your family sometime. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ When there's something worth telling them about. Yes. _END_PREVLINE_ I won't lie about it. If people ask, I'm going to say what's happened. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ No, you'll say, ask Ronnie. I deserve that much respect at least. _END_PREVLINE_ And what sort of respect are you showing me? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'm still here, aren't I? Don't push me faster than I want to go. It's my family. My rules. Okay? _END_PREVLINE_ How d'you want your eggs? Scrambled or fried? _EOL_  _BEGIN_SCENEINFO_ VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT NIGHT _END_SCENEINFO_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You're late. _END_PREVLINE_ Why, what did I miss? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Don't make me regret this. _END_PREVLINE_ Trust me. I'm good. How are you doing? Phil. Good to see you. Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out. With Louise. Just as long as you know - I was trying to help. Let's take that from it and move on, yes? Hey Roxy. Peggy. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ So what would you like? Pint? _END_PREVLINE_ No. I'm not stopping. There's no point. This ain't about us all having a drink and pretending to like each other for a false half hour - it's about starting again. Properly. I've got to prove myself to you all. I know that. So I've just come here now to say, I hope you'll give me that chance. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Whatever. _END_PREVLINE_ I know. Thanks. Sorry but, like you said, best not to push people faster than they want to go. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ No, you're right. _END_PREVLINE_ I'm going to go back and start preparing the club. Why don't you stay here for a bit? Talk me up. I think I need it. _EOL_ Nice suit. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Nice suit. _END_PREVLINE_ No problem.

I thought it was your turn to make breakfast? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Tell her to hurry up, can't you? Or get another loo. I can't go in the sink with you here. I'm kidding. What sort of bloke do you think I am? _END_PREVLINE_ A dead one if I catch you. How about you disinfect it while you're waiting? _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ I thought he was sitting this week out? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Nah. ‚S woman's work, isn't it? Get Ronnie to do it. _END_PREVLINE_ You either clean that sink, right now, or get out. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Well I don't suppose anything from the cafe or the chippy will be right? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack. Relax. I do not urinate in your sink. Okay? _END_PREVLINE_ But you like putting that thought in my head. Don't you? _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Shower. Now. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ But you like putting that thought in my head. Don't you? _END_PREVLINE_ Small man. Still needing his small victories. Even though it costs him his family. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Women on telly, they find the sweaty look sexy, love _END_NEXTLINE_ Thanks for coming. This is better, isn't it? We can talk properly now. Say what we want to say. Rather than what people we care about want to hear. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ So all that crap you came out with last night - _END_PREVLINE_ No, that was true. I do want us to get on. I like Ronnie, so obviously, it's in my interests. But it's not in your interests, is it Phil? You're thinking - why should I make the effort to get along with this cocky gitwho I don't even like. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Yes, that about sums it up. _END_PREVLINE_ Here's why. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Go on. You buy it. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He'd hang up as soon as you asked. It's too dangerous. The police nearly had us both the last time. _END_PREVLINE_ And with all this new evidence - they still might. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Go on, after you. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ And with all this new evidence - they still might. _END_PREVLINE_ You're a stupid man, Phil. You pick fights with people you know nothing about, with no understanding of how they might react. Well, you know now, don't you? _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ I'm still looking for inspiration. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ That ain't nothing. _END_PREVLINE_ It's enough. With what the police already have? More than. You sold stolen cars to Kevin Wicks who then died driving one - Yes, that's it. Keep thinking with your fists. Make it even easier for me, why don't you? No, there's no-one else here. And I ain't recording it neither, but you've had your cheap sucker punch. You want to go toe to toe when my back ain't turned, let's do it - see how long you last. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Hey, what d'you mean? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What do you want? _END_PREVLINE_ For the tape? Nothing. I'm going to give you it back. It's just a warning, Phil. Take me seriously. Treat me with respect. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Oh. Right. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ And that's it? _END_PREVLINE_ That and the car lot, yes. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Out of sight, out of mind. We decided that everyone needed their personal space, didn't we Billy? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What? _END_PREVLINE_ You're going to sell me the freehold for the car lot. At half the market price. As a way of apologizing. Let's call it a gesture of friendship. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ yeah...We might pop in for a quickie later. A drink, I mean. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Let's not. _END_PREVLINE_ That's bad news for Ben, isn't it? Cos once I give that tape to the police, you won't be seeing him for quite a while. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ You won't see me anyway. Coz I'll be out. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You taking the long term view of all this? _END_PREVLINE_ More than you ever did. See, I make it my business to know exactly who I'm dealing with, what they're capable of. Shame you never did the same. Just be grateful all I want is the car lot. You've got until 5pm. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ With a man. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I don't own that land. _END_PREVLINE_ I know. Peggy does. That's not my problem. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Okay. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I tell Ronnie this, it will be. That's you and her over - _END_PREVLINE_ You tell Ronnie this, the tape goes to the police. You threaten Darren, it goes to the police. This is just between you and me. To clear the air. Make things even between us. See, I really did try and help you with Louise, Phil, and now you owe me something in return. So why don't you phone your bent solicitor Ritchie Scott and start saving yourself while you still can. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You really want to do this? _END_PREVLINE_ I am doing it. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Jack helped them. _END_PREVLINE_ Phil, what are you drinking? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ It's just some papers that need a witness signature. For Ben's trust fund. Ritchie's bringing them over this afternoon. You don't mind, do you? _END_PREVLINE_ Hey Peggy? When you're ready. One more for the road, yes? _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Early start. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Hey Peggy? When you're ready. One more for the road, yes? _END_PREVLINE_ Phil, come and join us. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ If it turns out to be a disappointment, I'll be at the club. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He's still breathing, isn't he? _END_PREVLINE_ Same again all round, only let's make it doubles - We're celebrating, after all - and you've got join us this time, Peggy. No excuses. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ He's worth it. _END_NEXTLINE_ I know. Change of plan. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I know. Change of plan. _END_PREVLINE_ You might have mentioned Phil had bribed you beforehand. 200 notes to keep quiet? That makes you an accomplice, you muppet. I give that tape to the police now you two'll be sharing a cell - is that how you want this to go? Well? Look, you wanted revenge for Kevin, right? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You might have mentioned Phil had bribed you beforehand. 200 notes to keep quiet? That makes you an accomplice, you muppet. I give that tape to the police now you two'll be sharing a cell - is that how you want this to go? Well? Look, you wanted revenge for Kevin, right? _END_PREVLINE_ And that's exactly what he's going to do. He's going to pay by giving you the car lot. The freehold, it's yours. That's right. He'll sign it over to me first, then I'll give it to you when you're 18. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ And that's exactly what he's going to do. He's going to pay by giving you the car lot. The freehold, it's yours. That's right. He'll sign it over to me first, then I'll give it to you when you're 18. _END_PREVLINE_ Don't worry. He can't touch you. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Don't worry. He can't touch you. _END_PREVLINE_ Trust me. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Trust me. _END_PREVLINE_ Darren, listen - _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ No, I'm just doing a favour for Dawn. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Darren, listen - _END_PREVLINE_ Just get a grip, okay? Look at me. You're going to be fine. Phil won't hurt you. I guarantee it. Now sit down. And listen up, cos what you decide here Darren, is going to determine how the rest of your life goes. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ You're doing alright. _END_NEXTLINE_ I chose you for a reason, Darren. You're ambitious, motivated and you've got a world of guts - not many people would've agreed to take Phil Mitchell on. But you need to prove to me you can live with the pressure of the choices you make. Do that, and you'll be owning a lot more than a crappy car lot in a few years time. See, what I'm offering you here, is an apprenticeship. If you can't handle it just say so now. I'll give you some money, you can head off, start again somewhere else. Or you can accept the risk, stay here, and learn how to really play the game. It's up to you. That or this. What are you going to do? _EOL_ You're late. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ So call the police. _END_PREVLINE_ What are you having? _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ This is a great idea, Billy. It's like our very own house-warming! _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Now? Or eventually. _END_PREVLINE_ See, that's sharp. I like that. We could really get on, you and me - if you just gave us a chance. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ HOney can you take your go because I can't stay like this much longer. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You're right. I didn't treat you with any respect. Now I know who I'm dealing with, I'll play things differently. Okay? Tape. _END_PREVLINE_ That's the original - on the memory card. And that's the copy I made for the sound system this morning. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ I'll do it for ya... Left foot green.. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ That better be the only copy. You come asking for something else, you know what you'll get. _END_PREVLINE_ Like I said, this makes us even. All I want now, Phil, is your friendship. You need a favour from me, it's yours. Just ask. That's how this thing should work. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Sorry mate. _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I'll bear that in mind. _END_PREVLINE_ No hard feelings then. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Yes, you can.

Trust me, I can handle it. _END_PREVLINE_ is that for me? _EOL_ Do what you need to do. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Is it? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Buy a girl a drink? _END_PREVLINE_ Nice try. But I think you won the bet hours ago. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ Oh Billy, what have you done? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Nice try. But I think you won the bet hours ago. _END_PREVLINE_ Out the back. _EOL_ What are you doing working back here? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Oh Tracey's ill so Peggy twisted my arm, don't worry I'll be at the club by eight on time. Talk about mutton. Three guesses who gave it to her. _END_PREVLINE_ So how did the apology go down? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ It didn't. _END_PREVLINE_ Look this thing between you two and your dad - what's the big deal? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I know exactly what will have happened. He'll have shown up late with some other woman in tow. Because Daddy's got his little girl a present none of us _END_PREVLINE_ But you still going to Phil's birthday do? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Mmm, I'm dreading it. _END_PREVLINE_ The offer's still open, you know. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. _END_PREVLINE_ Here, Phil.

What time's Jack coming over? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ We can move things around. _END_PREVLINE_ Alright, but it'd save us a wage. Wouldn't have to employ so many outsiders. Plus it's a better job. You could be Assistant Manager. _EOL_  _BEGIN_NEXTLINE_ You sure about that? _END_NEXTLINE_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ There isn't one. _END_PREVLINE_ Exactly.

You're trying to sabotage tonight before it's even begun. _END_PREVLINE_ I beg your pardon? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ You're just determined to have a miserable night. _END_PREVLINE_ Can I just point out that tonight was NOT my idea? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ This is my partner, Ashley. _END_PREVLINE_ Oh.

Not everyone's used to half naked homosexuals in the morning, Christian. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Ian getting hot under the collar, is he? _END_PREVLINE_ Ian's got certain standards. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Bet he's got all the rules written down somewhere. Laminated. _END_PREVLINE_ If you're staying in his house. Better for everyone, if you go along with them. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I was joking. _END_PREVLINE_ You have to be organised in business. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What's it about? _END_PREVLINE_ Christian!

Oh come on, give the poor bloke a break. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Do you love him? Really? _END_PREVLINE_ Of course I do. However hard that might be for you to believe, Christian. I love Ian very much. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ So, if Ian's your dream man. Why all the romantic fiction? _END_PREVLINE_ It's not romantic fiction.

And that's all Grant was. Sex. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Was it any good? _END_PREVLINE_ Bloody brilliant! But that's not the point. Grant was like... too many shots of tequila.

Turning a very fetching shade of blue I see? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Reckon it suits me? It's my favourite colour. _END_PREVLINE_ What made Phil lose it like that? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Been asking myself the same thing.

Then he comes along and dangles her in front of me. _END_PREVLINE_ He didn't... _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What would you call it then? Jack told me to wait, but I couldn't. What father would? _END_PREVLINE_ What did you do Phil? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ To her I was just some big scary man. _END_PREVLINE_ Leave it Aunt Peg. _EOL_ I'm sorry about Louise, but how can you blame Jack? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Easy. _END_PREVLINE_ He did what he said Phil. He was trying to help you. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Was he? _END_PREVLINE_ Of course. He found her for you, didn't he?

Jack knew Lisa was with this bloke. That they were one big happy family. He knew Ronnie. He knew everything. _END_PREVLINE_ But why would he? I mean... _EOL_ I can't believe he'd do that. It sounds so paranoid. Let's face it, Phil's never liked Jack. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Who's side are you on? _END_PREVLINE_ Not you as well. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Ron. Jack's driving a wedge between this family. If you can't see it, it's only ‚cos you don't want to. _END_PREVLINE_ That's rubbish. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ See?

Circling the wagons. _END_PREVLINE_ No-one tells me what to do. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ Which is one of the things I like about you. We still solvent? _END_PREVLINE_ He's in pieces. So's Aunt Peg. If you'd seen her... _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ What can I do? _END_PREVLINE_ Phil thinks you set him up. That you knew Louise had a step-dad. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He's so predictable. _END_PREVLINE_ Did you Jack? _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ I did my bit. If Phil can't handle it, it's his problem. _END_PREVLINE_ That's not an answer. It's all about scoring points with you two. Tit for tat. You win, he loses and vice versa. Boys playing their war games. _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ No. _END_PREVLINE_ You know what Jack?

I'm just waiting for the moment you realize Jack's even worse. _END_PREVLINE_ It's good you're so grateful to him. Helping you out, putting a roof over your head - _EOL_  _BEGIN_PREVLINE_ He's just storing up credit, that's all. Making sure everyone knows he disapproves but then taking me in anyway - cos I'm family. That great East End myth we all peddle - like the hypocrites we are. _END_PREVLINE_ Say the same thing to Tanya, would you? If she asked you to come home? You're right. We're all hypocrites, Max.
